## Who am I?

My name is Heath Farrow. I am a software developer who has worked in the games industry since 2008 at companies such as 
Electronic Arts, Disney, and Blizzard Entertainment. See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathfarrow/) profile 
for my professional job history.

You can find various hobby projects from over the years on [GitHub](https://github.com/hfarrow?tab=repositories). 
Several projects are old and incomplete but contain code nonetheless. I do share my "dot files" for 
[ZSH](https://github.com/hfarrow/dotbash) and [Neovim](https://github.com/hfarrow/dotneovim). The source for this 
[static site](https://github.com/hfarrow/hfarrow.github.io) is also available.

## What is this blog?

This is my personal development journal. My motivation for starting a journal is to document interesting problems I run 
into and any learning I desire to take the time to write about. I don't have an intended audience for what I write but 
perhaps the journal provides a look into my interests, projects, and approach to problem solving.

This blog site itself is somewhat of a hobby project itself. I frequently use Neovim for text editing and as a hobby 
project IDE. I decided to use a static site generator and Neovim to write all content for the site. I see it as an 
opportunity to better utilize Neovim as a text editor and become more comfortable with Markdown authoring.

## About this site

This site is hosted by GitHub Pages and generated by Hugo, a static site generator. The site is published by a GitHub 
action when the `main` branch is pushed. I chose Hugo because I had previously experimented Jekyll in an early but 
mostly empty iteration of this site. I wanted to try something different and I was also interested in using a GitHub 
Action to publish the site. GitHub pages will publish Jekyll sites automatically without the need for an GitHub Action.

I chose a popular theme for Hugo named PaperMod. I like it for it's simplicity and availability of dark and light modes. 
I looked at portfolio themes that can better showcase projects and work history; however, I don't have projects I wish 
to showcase for now. I may switch to another theme or extend PaperMod in the future if desired.
